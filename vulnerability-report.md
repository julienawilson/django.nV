A1 - Injection
    1) How you found and exploited the vulnerability, including the code/method you used
        The upload view takes raw input and adds to directly to a sql statement.  By adding youre own sql, to that raw input you can control what it does.  Adding a '--' to the end of the input cancels any other sql that comes afterwards.  I tried to use the provided example: testPic',(select password from auth_user where username='admin'),8);--   in the upload form, but it didnt work for me.  


    2) What you were able to do with the vulnerability (i.e. what was exposed?)
        I could insert raw sql, but I was not able to view the admin password.  I tried uploading a file with the name of the admin password.  

    3) The code that fixes the vulnerability
        To fix the vulnerablity, we just needed to change to file upload system to use the Django ORM.

A2 - Broken Auth
    1) How you found and exploited the vulnerability, including the code/method you used
        In the forms.py you can see which form items are excluded.  By editing the html on the page to include the user_permissions field, you can make yourself a superuser and staff.  You can then use your credentials to sign in to the admin page.

    2) What you were able to do with the vulnerability (i.e. what was exposed?)
        I was able to log in to the admin page.

    3) The code that fixes the vulnerability
        Replacing the blacklist with a whitelist of 'included values' would help.  

A3 - XSS
    1) How you found and exploited the vulnerability, including the code/method you used
        We found that in the base template, the username was rendered using `{{ user.username|safe }}` so we knew we could make it render properly formatted html.
        We registered and logged in then went to edit our profile. We edited our username to a script tag containting some JS code : `<script>alert("I'm a hacker)</script>`

    2) What you were able to do with the vulnerability (i.e. what was exposed?)
        We were able to run the script every page load.

    3) The code that fixes the vulnerability
        Changing `{{ user.username|safe }}` to `{{ user.username }}`


A4 - Insecure DOR
    1) How you found and exploited the vulnerability, including the code/method you used
        We were able to visit urls that should have been protected.  For example, while we were logged out, we could see peoples projects on the dashboard.  We were also able to edit anybody's profile, inlcuding the admin's.

    2) What you were able to do with the vulnerability (i.e. what was exposed?)
        We changed the admin's email address.

    3) The code that fixes the vulnerability
        Adding login required mixins would help.  Adding a check in the views to make sure the user that is logged in matches the user's profile.
